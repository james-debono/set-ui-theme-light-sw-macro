# Set UI Theme - Light

A SOLIDWORKS macro that switches the interface to the Light brightness theme
from a toolbar button, instead of clicking through **Tools > Options > System
Options > Colors** every time.

Works with SOLIDWORKS 2022, 2024 and 2025.

## What it does

Applies the **Light** interface brightness theme, which covers the
CommandManager, FeatureManager, menus and task pane. The graphics area behind
your model is a separate setting.

It writes a **system option**, not a document property. Nothing is saved into
any part, assembly or drawing, and the setting persists across documents and
sessions until changed again.

## Install

**The macro on its own:** download `Set-UI-Theme-Light.swp` from the [latest
release](../../releases/latest), then run it with **Tools > Macro > Run**, or
add it to a toolbar with **Tools > Customize > Commands > Macro**. **Tools >
Customize > Keyboard** assigns a keyboard shortcut instead.

**With [MacroShelf](https://github.com/james-debono/macroshelf-sw-addin):** get
the [MacroShelf
Collection](https://github.com/james-debono/macroshelf-collection-sw-macro-library/releases/latest),
which packages this macro with its icon and hover text alongside every other
macro in the set. The five theme macros appear together as a Themes drop-down.

## Known quirk

Running this macro can pop a Windows **Script Error** dialog. Click Yes; the
theme applies correctly.

This comes from SOLIDWORKS' own task pane code, not from the macro — changing
the theme by hand in System Options produces the same dialog. Collapsing the
task pane before switching avoids it. Details are in
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Building from source

`src/Set-UI-Theme-Light.vba` is the source. A `.swp` is a binary VBA project, so
it has to be created from inside SOLIDWORKS — there is no build step:

1. **Tools > Macro > New…**, and save it with the matching name.
2. The VBA editor opens on an empty `Sub main()`. Select all and delete.
3. Paste in the whole contents of the `.vba`.
4. Save and close the editor.

Nothing needs adding under **Tools > References** — a new SOLIDWORKS macro
already references the `SldWorks` and `swconst` type libraries, which is what
supplies the enum names the source uses.

Only Light and Dark have interface macros. For Medium or Medium Light, copy the
source and swap the constant for `swInterfaceBrightnessTheme_Medium` or
`..._MediumLight` — but read the enum-ordering trap in
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) first, because the enum is **not** in
the same order as the dropdown.

## Licence

MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Free to use, modify and share. The full licence
text is also carried inside the macro itself, so a `.swp` passed on by itself
still carries its licence.
